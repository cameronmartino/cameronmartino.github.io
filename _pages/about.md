I am a Systems Biology PhD student at the University of California, San Diego. My PhD work is under the mentorship of Dr. Rob Knight. I aim to advance longitudinal multi-omics investigation â€” to explore the vast microbial space for host-microbe interactions of value. By leveraging experimental and computational -biology in conjunction, I hope to gain a systems-level understanding of how these complex host-microbe systems are formed and perpetuated. 

In my free time, I enjoy spending time in the ocean by either surfing, fishing or swimming. When the waves are flat you can find me on my road bike or relaxing with my dog.

Bio
======

I am a microbiologist and computational biologist. I am interested in all the extraordinary things microbes do, including the primordial microbes that live within us.

My research focuses on leveraging experimental and computational -biology in conjunction, to advance our understanding of how complex host-microbe systems are formed and perpetuated.

I have helped develop several [compositional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_data) methods to better visualize how microbial communities differ between source environments (*[Martino et al., 2019](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mSystems.00016-19)*, *[Martino et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0660-7)*, *[Fedarko et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqaa023)*, *[Cantrell et al., 2020](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mSystems.01216-20)*). These methods help to better understand how host resident microbial communities are formed, develop as we age, and impact our health (*[Song, Wang, and Martino et al., 2019](https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(21)00203-8)*). Many important host-microbe interactions are governed by the alterations/use of [glycans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycan]). Examples in my research of microbe-host-glycan interactions, are how the breakdown of the food we eat can impact health ([Zaramela & Martino et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0564-9)) and how modification of the host cell glycans (known as the [glycocalyx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycocalyx)) impact our susceptibility to diseases like COVID-19 ([Martino et al., 2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.238444v1.full)). 

When not studying microbes I like to spend time in the ocean (sneaking into a rad barrel below) or ride my bike.

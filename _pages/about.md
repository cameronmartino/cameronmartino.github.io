I am a Systems Biology PhD student at the University of California, San Diego. My PhD work is under the mentorship of Dr. Rob Knight. My research focuses on advancing longitudinal multi-omics investigation â€” to explore the vast microbial space for host-microbe interactions of value. I strive to contribute to the next wave of effective, safe, and affordable microbial therapeutics to better the lives of people with chronic diseases.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time in the ocean by either surfing, fishing or swimming. When the waves are flat you can find me on my road bike or relaxing with my dog.

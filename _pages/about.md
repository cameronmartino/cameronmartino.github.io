I am a [Bioinformatics & Systems Biology](https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/) PhD student at UC San Diego. My PhD work is under the mentorship of [Dr. Rob Knight](https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/). By leveraging experimental and computational -biology in conjunction, I hope to advance our understanding of how complex host-microbe systems are formed and perpetuated.
